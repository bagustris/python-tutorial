## Python programs are plain text files.

*   They use the `.py` extension by convention.
*   It's common to write them using a text editor or running interactively using ipython,
    but we are going to use the [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter].
    *   Notebook files use `.ipynb` extension.
    *   Provides code completion and other helpful features.

## IPtyhon
*   Open it with --pylab option to enable plot interatively
*   When you need to edit the module and want to take effect immedietly use autoload magic

~~~
%load_ext autoreload
from module1 import function1
## edit module1
%autoreload 2

~~~
{: .python}

For more information about autoreload, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html?highlight=autoreload).

## Use the Jupyter Notebook for editing and running Python.

*   The [Anaconda package manager][anaconda] is an automated way to install the Jupyter notebook.
    *   See [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/) for Anaconda installation instructions.
*   "Batteries included": comes with lots of scientific libraries.
*   Once you have installed Python and the Jupyter Notebook requirements, open a shell and type:

    ~~~
    $ jupyter notebook
    ~~~
    {: .source}

*   This will start a Jupyter Notebook server and open your default web browser.
*   You can type code into the browser and see the result when the web page talks to the server.
*   This has several advantages:
    *   You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.
    *   Tab complete allows you to easily access the names of things you are using
        and learn more about them.
    *   It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, etc.
        to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.
    *   It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them
        to tell a complete story of the analysis.


> ## How It's Stored
>
> *   The notebook file is stored in a format called JSON.
> *   Just like a webpage, what's saved looks different from what you see in your browser.
> *   But this format allows Jupyter to mix software (in several languages) with documentation
      and graphics, all in one file.
{: .callout}

## The Notebook has Control and Edit modes.

*   Open a new notebook from the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the file browser page.
*   Each notebook contains one or more cells of various types.

> ## Code vs. Text
>
> We often use the term "code" to mean
> "the source code of software written in a language such as Python".
> A "code cell" in a Notebook is a cell that contains software;
> a "text cell" is one that contains ordinary prose written for human beings.
{: .callout}

*   If you press "esc" and "return" alternately,
    the outer border of your code cell will change from gray to green.
    *   The difference in color is subtle.
*   These are the control (gray) and edit (green) modes of your notebook.
*   If you use the "esc" and "return" keys to make the surround gray
    and then press the "H" key,
    a list of all the shortcut keys will appear.
*   When in control mode (esc/gray),
    *   The "B" key will make a new cell below the currently selected cell.
    *   The "A" key will make one above.
    *   The "X" key will delete the current cell.
*   All actions can be done using the menus,
    but there are lots of keyboard shortcuts to speed things up.
*   If you remember the "esc" and "H" shortcut, you will be able to find out all the rest.

## Use the keyboard and mouse to select and edit cells.

*   Pressing the "return" key turns the surround green to
    signify edit mode and you can type into the cell.
*   Because we want to be able to write many lines of code in a single cell,
    pressing the "return" key when the border is green moves the cursor to the next line in the cell
    just like in a text editor.
*   We need some other way to tell the Notebook we want to run what's in the cell.
*   Pressing the "return" key and the "shift" key together will execute the contents of the cell.

## The Notebook will turn Markdown into pretty-printed documentation.

*   Notebooks can also render [Markdown][markdown].
    *   A simple plain-text format for writing lists, links,
        and other things that might go into a web page.
    *   Equivalently, a subset of HTML that looks like what you'd send in an old-fashioned email.
*   Turn the current cell into a Markdown cell by entering
    the control mode (esc/gray) and press the "M" key.
*   `In [ ]:` will disappear to show it is no longer a code cell
    and you will be able to write in Markdown.
*   Turn the current cell into a Code cell
    by entering the control mode (esc/gray) and press the "Y" key.

## Markdown does most of what HTML does.

## Use variables to store values.

*   Variables are names for values.
    *   Like sticky notes rather than locations in memory.
*   Use `var = value` to do assignment.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.

~~~
age = 42
first_name = 'Ahmed'
~~~
{: .python}

*   Variable names:
    *   cannot start with a digit
    *   cannot contain spaces, quotation marks, or other punctuation
    *   *may* contain an underscore (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
*   Underscores at the start like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values.

*   Built-in function `print` displays things as text.

~~~
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items and a newline at the end.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error.
    *   Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.

~~~
print(last_name)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(last_name)

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   Variables defined in one cell exist in all other cells once executed,
    so the relative location of cells in the notebook do not matter
    (i.e., cells lower down can still affect those above).

## Python provides the usual atomic types and operators.

*   `int`, `float`, and `str`.
*   `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, '%', and '^' on numbers.
    *   `int/int` keeps the fractional part.
    *   `int//int` is integer division.
*   `+` and `*` on strings.
    *   Which can be written using either single or double quotes.
    *   And may include the usual C escape characters like `\t` and `\n`.

## Index and slice to get information out of a string.

*   Locations are numbered from 0 rather than 1.
*   Negative indices count backward from the end of the string.
*   Slices *include* the lower bound but *exclude* the upper bound.
    *   So `upper-lower` is the slice's length.

~~~
element = 'helium'
print('first character:', element[0])
print('last character:', element[-1])
print('middle:', element[2:5])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
first character: h
last character: m
middle: liu
~~~
{: .output}

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

~~~
print(len('helium'))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

## Python containers
Python includes several built-in containers types: list, dictionaries, sets, and tupple.

## A list stores many values in a one-dimensional structure.

*   Values separated by ',' contained within square brackets `[...]`.
*   Index, slice, and use `len` the same way as strings.

~~~
pressures = [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
print('pressures:', pressures)
print('length:', len(pressures))
print('second value:', pressures[1])
print('middle:', pressures[1:-1])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
pressures: [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
length: 5
second value: 0.275
middle: [0.275, 0.277, 0.275]
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them.

~~~
pressures[0] = 0.265
print('pressures is now:', pressures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
pressures is now: [0.265, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
~~~
{: .output}

## Appending items to a list lengthens it.

*   Use `list.append` to add items to the end of a list.

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5]
print('primes is initially:', primes)
primes.append(7)
primes.append(9)
print('primes has become:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes is initially: [2, 3, 5]
primes has become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
~~~
{: .python}

*   `append` is a *method* of lists.
    *   Like a function, but tied to a particular object.
*   Use `object_name.method_name` to call methods.
    *   Deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.
*   We will meet other methods of lists as we go along.
    *   Use `help(list)` for a preview.

## Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely.

*   `del list_name[index]` removes an item from a list and shortens the list.
*   Not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

~~~
print('primes before removing last item:', primes)
del primes[4]
print('primes after removing last item:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes before removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes after removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

## The empty list contains no values.

*   `[]` is "the zero of lists".

## Lists may be *heterogeneous*.

~~~
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .python}

*   Not always a good idea...

## Character strings are *immutable*.

*   Cannot change the characters in a string after it has been created.
*   Python considers the string to be a single value with parts,
    not a collection of values.

~~~
element[0] = 'C'
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .error}

## Indexing beyond the end of a collection is an error.

*   Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist.

~~~
print('99th element of element is:', element[99])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
IndexError: string index out of range
~~~
{: .output}
