This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people who are already comfortable in some other language
such as Perl or MATLAB.
This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
